# HotAndCold Raids

The MMO Version of HotAndCold.

Guess the secret word by entering words with similar meanings. Words are scored based on how semantically related they are to the target word.

Example: If the secret word is "ocean":

- sea: would score 80-100 (highly related)
- wave: would score 40-79 (somewhat related)
- calculator: would score 0-39 (distantly/unrelated)

Think about synonyms, categories, and related concepts to find the secret word.
