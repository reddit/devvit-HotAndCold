# HotAndCold

Your mission is to guess the secret word by entering words with similar meanings. Each guess is scored based on how closely it's related to the target word.

For example, if the secret word is "ocean":

- sea might score 80–100 (highly related)
- wave might score 40–79 (somewhat related)
- calculator might score 0–39 (unrelated)

Use your knowledge of synonyms, categories, and related concepts to zero in on the answer. It’s a unique twist on word guessing, perfect for language lovers and puzzle fans alike.

Start guessing – the closer your words, the hotter you get!
